## Chapter template

Basic template for each chapter.

	## Background C and C++
	
	How it is done in C and C++ 98 and modern C++
	
	## New syntax cppfront
	
	Shows how is done now
	
	
	## How is the code transpiled
	
	## Advanced topics
	
	Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
	If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.
