- [ ] Explore (also subfolders): https://herbsutter.com/2023/04/30/cppfront-spring-update/ 

- [ ] Show that the compiler when compiles a cpp file generated by cpp2, will show all error/warnings with references to cpp2 file, like the debuger does (I tested with gcc so far).

- [ ] Add each topic in Ket Features chapter a link to the other chapter where the topic will be explored deeply

- [ ] For each possible combination of attributes for `this` and `that` (and also params in normal function) show what the combination in Cppfront will generate in C++. E.g. in, out, inout, move, implicit, virtual, override, implicit...: https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/wiki/Cpp2:-operator=,-this-&-that
