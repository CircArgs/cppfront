## Background C and C++

How it is done in C and C++ 98 and modern C++

## New syntax cppfront

Shows how is done now


## How is the code transpiled

## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.

Witness the culmination of your learning as we guide you in crafting your first cppfront application. This section will cover:
   - Introduction to the "main:" function.
   - Navigating program "args" and their utility.
   - The convenience of "std::cout" with format specifications.
   - Delve into the "std" library, which is inherently included in cppfront.
   - Decoding the Generated C++: One of the essential skills when working with cppfront is understanding the C++ output it produces. We'll help you become proficient in analyzing the generated C++ code, emphasizing its importance for deeper mastery of the language.
