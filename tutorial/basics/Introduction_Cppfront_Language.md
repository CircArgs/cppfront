Kickstart your cppfront journey with a broad overview, understanding its origins, purposes, and its position in the evolving landscape of programming languages.

	* Work in progress, instable
	* Safety

Cppfront is an experimental compiler from a potential C++ 'syntax 2' (Cpp2) to today's 'syntax 1' (Cpp1). It proposes to follow the compatible with c++ by design approach.
Cppfront has being developed by Herb Sutter for a while.
It has received support of peaple in the community (entusiasts).
This tutorial intends to teach Cppfront.
It is public in the internet.
It is not yet ready for production.
The main reference for this tutorial is the GitHub repository of Cppfront.
Cppfront aims total compatibility with modern C++ (e.g. C++20) allowing the reuse of all the existing tools, libraries and acosystems.



How it is done in C and C++ 98 and modern C++

## New syntax cppfront

Shows how is done now


## How is the code transpiled

## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.
