Back to the Chapter [Overview](Overview.md)

## Background C and C++

How it is done in C and C++ 98 and modern C++

## New syntax cppfront

Shows how is done now


## How is the code transpiled

## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.

Discover the essence of cppfront through its salient features. This section emphasizes:
   - Integrating tools: Unravel the workings of compilers and debuggers within the cppfront ecosystem.
   - Bridging with C++ Syntax: Learn how to seamlessly use C++ syntax within cppfront, ensuring a smoother transition and enhanced compatibility.
   - Preprocessors in Action: Understand the significance of '#' for macros and delve into the intricacies of "include" functionalities.
   - Beyond the Basics: While this tutorial focuses on the fundamentals, it's imperative to note that anything from C++ not explicitly covered here can be integrated into cppfront. This feature accentuates the language's versatility.
