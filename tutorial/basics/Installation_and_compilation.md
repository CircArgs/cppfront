## Installation

This tutorial has also some exemplo proggrams in the folder [cppfront]/proj
In Linux it is necessary to run the init.sh script with `. ./init.sh` to create the environment variables.

Show that the compiler when compiles a cpp file generated by cpp2, will show all error/warnings with references to cpp2 file, like the debuger does (I tested with gcc so far).


## Debugging



## Code Explorer

## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.

Use [Cppfront Code Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/7qGso819c) to play with the syntax


Dive into the technicalities of setting up cppfront. This segment will guide you through the installation process, demonstrate how to effectively compile the tool, and acquaint you with its primary features. We'll make sure you're well-versed with the various options available to maximize the tool's utility.
